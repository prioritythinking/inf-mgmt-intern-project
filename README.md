# Web Development Internship Project

## To the best of your abilities, please complete the following tasks:
 
- Look over the SurveyData.json file which is the result of an API call to a web service called SurveyGizmo.com. Write a SQL Create Table script for three tables; Pages, Questions, and Question_Options which will store the respective Json data.
- Using the Process Flow Diagram Template, outline the process you would write to parse the Json data into the database tables in an ASP.NET application. Provide reference to any ASP.NET packages you would use to assist in this task.
- Find the SurveyGizmo REST API documentation and build a Version 5 PUT call to create a required question with type "essay" on page 2 with survey ID "123456".
