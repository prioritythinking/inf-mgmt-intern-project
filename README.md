# Information Management Internship Project

This task was carefully designed to reflect many of the day-to-day tasks we expect our information management department interns to be able to perform. Once you have completed, please email the project in a zipped folder.

Because this position for the summer of 2021 will be remote, it is important that applicants are able to work independently given a set of business requirements. This is simply meant to be a tool for us to gauge your abilities in process design, problem solving, and time management. Please do not spend more than one hour on this task.

## To the best of your abilities, please complete the following tasks:
 
- Look over the SurveyData.txt JSON file which is the result of an API call to a survey platform called Alchemer (formerly SurveyGizmo). Write a SQL "Create Table" script for three tables; Pages, Questions, and Question_Options which will store the respective Json data. Please include the necessary keys and constraints.
- Using the Process Flow Diagram Template, outline the process you would write to parse the Json data into the database tables in an ASP.NET web application. Provide reference to any ASP.NET packages you would use to assist in this task. No need to write code for this task.
- Find the Alchemer REST API documentation and build a Version 5 PUT call to create a required question with type "essay" at the top of the second page of the survey which has a survey ID of "123456".
