# Information Management Internship Project

This task was carefully designed to reflect many of the day-to-day tasks we expect our information management department interns to be able to perform. Please do not spend more than one hour on this task. It is not meant to be perfect, just a tool for us to gauge your abilities in process design, problem solving, and time management. Once you have completed, please email the project in a zipped folder.

## To the best of your abilities, please complete the following tasks:
 
- Look over the SurveyData.txt JSON file which is the result of an API call to a web service called Alchemer.com. Write a SQL Create Table script for three tables; Pages, Questions, and Question_Options which will store the respective Json data.
- Using the Process Flow Diagram Template, outline the process you would write to parse the Json data into the database tables in an ASP.NET application. Provide reference to any ASP.NET packages you would use to assist in this task.
- Find the Alchemer REST API documentation and build a Version 5 PUT call to create a required question with type "essay" at the top of the second page of the survey which has a survey ID of "123456".
